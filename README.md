# Ago Lepiksaar

**` Rather a curious one (Beginner developer/Tinker/Investor)`**

I am a person who likes to build. Recently have rediscovered the joy of programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GO. Why- because my name is AGO
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mostly school projects from KOOD/JÃ•HVI and daily Leetcode

  <summary><h3>Short description of Ago and Coding/Tinkering</h3></summary>
  I started my relations with coding when I rolled in Taltech Specialty ArvutisÃ¼steemid(Computer Sciences). 
  Due to time shortage (became the father of two of the most awesome children in the world) did not finish my degree. 
  When I was out of school, fell in love with tinkering and building stuff. I literally built a House, went in with the 3D Printer craze, and made some small Arduino projects (Plotter, signature machine...).
  Now I joined KOOD/JÃ•HVI computer school because I feel I need to improve my coding skills to make and build anything i want
